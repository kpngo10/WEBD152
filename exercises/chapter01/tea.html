    <h3>Review of Jasmine Green Tea</h3>
    <p>I love green tea for various reasons: it's fragrant, light, pleasant, and has a chockful of antioxidant benefits.
    Green tea is caffeinated, but the content is nowhere as heavy as coffee. I highly recommend for anyone looking to reduce their caffeine intake.</p>
    <p>However, I understand jasmine isn't for everyone because of its fragrance. So if you want to explore green tea,
    there's plenty of options: matcha (finely ground powder), gyokuro (grown under the shade), sencha (grown under full sun), genmaicha (brown rice), oolong (Chinese roasted green tea), houjicha (Japanese roasted green tea).</p>
    <p>There's so much to talk about tea and I can go on forever. It's so good for your health. I think everyone should have a cup of tea daily for their inner peace.</p>
